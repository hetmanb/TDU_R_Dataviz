This is a first-use example of applying RMarkdown and bookdown to compile and share notes, towards building new course material for the TDU Data Visualization in R course (e.g., TDU R Dataviz). This is a minimal example of creating a book based on R Markdown and bookdown (&lt;https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown&gt;). The bookdown package can be installed using the following command in R: install.packages(bookdown) Or alternatively, one can download the developer version for the most up-to-date features: devtools::install_github(rstudio/bookdown) Additional resources: The bookdown book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ The bookdown package reference site: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Description 2.2 Prerequisites 2.3 Experiential Aims 2.4 Learning Objectives 2.5 Target Audience", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Description Welcome to the PHAC TDUs Data Visualization in R. This course will introduce public health practitioners and field epidemiologists with the skills necessary to use R to creating compelling data visualizations in R in the course of their work. The course consists of two half-day virtual sessions where participants review basic concepts, practice, and reflect upon the use of R to create figures and graphs. This course is oriented to provide epidemiologists and public health practitioners with additional skills and materials for use in the field and is not intended to be comprehensive training on either Scientific communications (incl.Â graphic design, or data visualization), or R overall. 2.2 Prerequisites Participants should have a background in epidemiology and have previously completed training in public health investigations and surveillance (or equivalent). Participants should also be comfortable performing basic tasks in R, such as loading, reshaping, and cleaning data as well as conducting descriptive epidemiological analyses. Please review the Self-Study Pre-Course Module for Introduction to R for Public Health Investigations for a refresher on fundamentals as needed. 2.3 Experiential Aims For participants to be comfortable practicing the ggplot2 package, facets, and theme functions. To reinforce and supplement previous Training and Development Unit learning on Scientific Communications (as applicable, not required) To create a relaxed and safe environment for practice, questions, share-back, and reflection. 2.4 Learning Objectives By the end of this course, participants will be able to: Describe the ggplot2 package and its use in creating compelling data visualisations in R. Use the ggplot2 package to create commonly used figures and graphs. Apply facets to create multi-panel plots. Create and apply built-in and user defined themes to figures. Leverage the functionality of R to apply best practices for accessibility as it relates to data visualisation (e.g., colour palettes, whitespace, texture and colour, and labeling). 2.5 Target Audience Public Health Agency of Canada epidemiologists involved in front-line service delivery, such as field epidemiologists from the Canadian Field Epidemiology Program and Public Health Officers from the Canadian Public Health Service.

"],["parts.html", "Chapter 4 Parts", " Chapter 4 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
