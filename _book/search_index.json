This is a first-use example of applying RMarkdown and bookdown to compile and share notes, towards building new course material for the TDU Data Visualization in R course (e.g., TDU R Dataviz). This is a minimal example of creating a book based on R Markdown and bookdown (&lt;https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown&gt;). The bookdown package can be installed using the following command in R: install.packages(bookdown) Or alternatively, one can download the developer version for the most up-to-date features: devtools::install_github(rstudio/bookdown) Interested in learning more about how this document was put together?

This course will introduce public health practitioners and field epidemiologists with the skills necessary to use R to creating compelling data visualizations in R in the course of their work. The course consists of two half-day virtual sessions where participants review basic concepts, practice, and reflect upon the use of R to create figures and graphs. This course is oriented to provide epidemiologists and public health practitioners with additional skills and materials for use in the field and is not intended to be comprehensive training on either Scientific communications (incl.Â graphic design, or data visualization), or R overall. 1.2 Prerequisites Participants should have a background in epidemiology and have previously completed training in public health investigations and surveillance (or equivalent). Participants should also be comfortable performing basic tasks in R, such as loading, reshaping, and cleaning data as well as conducting descriptive epidemiological analyses. Please review the Self-Study Pre-Course Module for Introduction to R for Public Health Investigations for a refresher on fundamentals as needed. 1.3 Experiential Aims For participants to be comfortable practicing the ggplot2 package, facets, and theme functions. To reinforce and supplement previous Training and Development Unit learning on Scientific Communications (as applicable, not required). To create a relaxed and safe environment for practice, questions, share-back, and reflection. 1.4 Learning Objectives By the end of this course, participants will be able to: Describe the ggplot2 package and its use in creating compelling data visualizations in R. Use the ggplot2 package to create commonly used figures and graphs. Apply facets to create multi-panel plots. Create and apply built-in and user defined themes to figures. Leverage the functionality of R to apply best practices for accessibility as it relates to data visualization (e.g., colour palettes, whitespace, texture and colour, and labeling). 1.5 Target Audience Public Health Agency of Canada epidemiologists involved in front-line service delivery, such as field epidemiologists from the Canadian Field Epidemiology Program and Public Health Officers from the Canadian Public Health Service. "],["datasets.html", "Chapter 2 Training Datasets for use in the course 2.1 Summary of datasets", " Chapter 2 Training Datasets for use in the course This chapter will include references to openly available datasets and provide some suggestions for how we can use them. 2.1 Summary of datasets The following tables provide links to data useful for either public-health based examples, or other fun examples for use. Note that some of these data sets are internal to the TDU and require internal permissions to access. For more information, or if you would like to gain access to an internal training data set, please contact the TDU.

For all of our data formatting examples, well be using packages native to the Tidyverse. Chances are, if youve gotten this far, then you already have the Tidyverse library installed on your computer! However, if youve somehow managed to sneak your way into the course and through the first couple chapters without installing it, then now is the time to do so! You can install the tidyverse on your computer by writing the following code into your R console and hitting enter: install.packages(tidyverse) Once youve done that, youll need to load the library to access all of the very helpful included packages and functions! Do this using the command: library(tidyverse) Note that when youre installing the package, the package name must be wrapped in quotation marks. However, when youre activating the package using the library() command, you dont need to use quotes. 3.2 Loading an example dataset For the following example, well use the data set Palmers Penguins. More information about this dataset can be found in Table 2.2.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["blocks.html", "Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations 5.2 Theorems and proofs 5.3 Callout blocks", " Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (5.1). 5.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 5.1.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
