# Welcome to TDU Dataviz in R! {-}

This is a first-use example of applying RMarkdown and **bookdown** to compile and share notes, towards building new course material for the **TDU Data Visualization in R** course (e.g., "TDU R Dataviz"). This is a minimal example of creating a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** ([<https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown>](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown)).

The **bookdown** package can be installed using the following command in R:

> install.packages("bookdown")

Or alternatively, one can download the developer version for the most up-to-date features:

> devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')
